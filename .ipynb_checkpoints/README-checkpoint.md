# Waste-treatment


This work is my final bootcamp Data Anlytics project from IronHack were I tried to aplly and use the majority of the bootcamp content, such as pandas, Numpy, data visualization (Tableau, matplotlib and Seaborn), ML algorithms (SKLEARN library).

Using a Dataset from The World Bank I analyzed the type of wastes and treatment of them by country. Trying to found out opportunity areas and clustered them with ML.

The information used, my code, and Tableau data visualizations can be found at the attached files.

Feel free to use this work is it for, and only for, non profit.
